# Image Classification using CNN

In this model I have tried to classifiy images of different animals using Covutional Neural Networks CNN.
This project is made and written in python. I have used several libraries like sklearn, tensorflow, pandas, tqdm, etc. to build this model.
This consist of 3 conv2d layers, 3 max_pooling layers, and a layer to flatten. 
I have used "ADAM" optimiser and was able to get an decent accuracy.
